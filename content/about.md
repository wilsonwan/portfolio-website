Hello! I'm Wilson, a Software Engineer based in London, UK.

I'm currently working at [dotdigital](https://dotdigital.com), working on making sure data flow seemlessly between Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce and dotdigital's Engagement Cloud.

I'm a huge nerd when it comes to shark, in fact, my whole reason for scuba diving is to hhang out with these puppy of the sea!
